# 🌟 ML Models Repository

This repository contains various machine learning models for **[your project purpose]**. Each model is designed to solve specific tasks efficiently.

## 📊 Models
This repository includes multiple models, such as:
- **Model 1** – [Brief description]
- **Model 2** – [Brief description]
- *(Add more models as needed)*

## ⚙️ Setup
To get started, install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

Multiple mini machine learning models are provided here with an interactive streamlit deployment for you to check it out.Further code,model and requirements.txt has been included in the folder for you to implement and deploy it yourself.
