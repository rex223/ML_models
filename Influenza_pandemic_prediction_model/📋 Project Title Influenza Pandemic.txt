Project Title: Generalized Influenza Pandemic Warning System for 2026

1. Project Overview

Goal: We’re working as a team to build a warning system that predicts if we will see an influenza pandemic in India, focusing on a state-level analysis. This system will detect most types of influenza.

2. What We Need to Build a Generalized Influenza Warning System

We need more types of information to track all influenza activity, detect new strains, and understand how influenza spreads and how bad it might get. Here’s what to look for:
a. Weekly or Monthly Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) Data

Why: ILI includes symptoms like fever and cough, which cover all influenza types (A, B, C) and new strains, not just H1N1. Pandemics grow quickly, so we need data every week or month.
Where to Get It: India’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) or state health departments (e.g., Maharashtra’s health reports).
What It Helps With: Spotting a sudden rise in influenza cases in 2026, like if cases triple in a few weeks, no matter the strain.
b. Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) Data

Why: SARI cases show severe illness requiring hospitalization, which can happen with any influenza type. A spike in SARI cases often means a serious outbreak.
Where to Get It: IDSP or state health departments for hospital admission data.
What It Helps With: Seeing if influenza in 2026 is causing more severe illness, which could signal a pandemic.
c. Weather Information

Why: Influenza spreads more in cold, dry weather or during monsoons (like January or August in India). This applies to all influenza types, and unusual weather could increase the risk.
Where to Get It: India Meteorological Department (IMD) for temperature, humidity, and rainfall data.
What It Helps With: Understanding if 2026 weather conditions might make influenza spread faster.
d. Virus Type Information (for New Strains)

Why: A new or more dangerous influenza strain (e.g., a mutated H1N1 or a new H5N1) could cause a pandemic. We need to know if a new strain appears.
Where to Get It: National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) or global databases like WHO’s FluNet.
What It Helps With: Checking if a new, fast-spreading influenza strain appears in 2026.
e. Zoonotic Influenza Data

Why: New pandemics often start from animal-to-human strains (e.g., H5N1, H9N2). India had an H9N2 case in 2024, so we need to watch for these.
Where to Get It: WHO India reports or IDSP (monitors avian influenza in poultry and humans).
What It Helps With: Spotting early signs of a new strain that could jump to humans and cause a pandemic.
f. Hospital and Healthcare Data

Why: If hospitals are already full, a big influenza outbreak could turn into a crisis, no matter the strain.
Where to Get It: State health departments or IDSP for hospital bed and ICU data.
What It Helps With: Seeing if hospitals in 2026 can handle a surge in influenza patients.
g. Population and Travel Data

Why: Crowded states and travel (e.g., during festivals like Diwali) help influenza spread faster, regardless of the type.
Where to Get It: Census of India for population data, and Indian Railways or news for travel trends.
What It Helps With: Identifying high-risk states like Maharashtra, where lots of people live and travel.
h. Social Media or Search Trends

Why: People often search or post about symptoms (like “fever” or “cough”) before going to a doctor, which can give early warnings of an outbreak.
Where to Get It: Google Trends or posts on platforms like X.
What It Helps With: Spotting early signs of an influenza outbreak in 2026, no matter the strain.
4. How We’ll Use This Information

We’ll combine all this data to build a warning system that predicts if 2026 will have an influenza pandemic, focusing on all influenza types and new strains.
How It Works:
We’ll use weekly ILI data to track overall influenza activity, not just one strain.
We’ll look for rapid increases in cases (e.g., cases doubling in a few weeks), severe illness (e.g., more SARI cases), and signs of new strains (e.g., from NCDC reports).
We’ll also check weather, hospital data, and travel patterns to see if conditions are right for a big outbreak.
Example: If ILI cases in Maharashtra jump from 1,000 to 3,000 in three weeks in January 2026, the weather is cold and dry, hospitals are full, and NCDC reports a new influenza strain, our system will warn us of a possible pandemic.
Plan: We’ll focus on one state (like Maharashtra) to keep it manageable, but we can compare trends across states.
